To build the project:
./setup.sh
cd build
make

Remember to give good path to your Qt installation in setup.sh

base is main program. It works as a daemon so to close it nicely use:
kill -s SIGINT <PID>

Daemon stores it's logs in /tmp.
Daemon looks for some standard path so it would be good if the exist:

    /usr/local/nscav2 - main directory
    /usr/loacl/nscav2/etc - default directory for config file
    /usr/local/nscav2/crypto - directory where keys are stored by default
    /usr/local/nscav2/var/buf - default directory for round robin buffers

Sample configs are in sampleConfig directory.

ENJOY!
